# helium-code-test

This contains the code of the helium recruitment test

## How to run

In order to run the code, please clone the repo locally, go into `Server` directory through `cd Server` (through the terminal). Here run the commands `npm install` and `npm run install-client`, this will install all the necessary packages to the directories without you having to go into each one individually.

Once packages are installed, you can run both the server and client with the command `npm run helium-test`. Should this fail, please go into both directories with different terminals and run the commands `npm start`.

Feel free to contact me on my mail in case of any issues.
